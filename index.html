        <p> Pink Panther is a cartoon where the main character is a panther that's pink! that's why it's name "Pink panther".There's barely any speaking, but it's hilarious! It's sort of like Mr.Bean.It also has a lot of sound effects and songs too. That's what I like about it. Mainly, what I like about Pink panther is that he's pink and that he's also really sneaky and steals a lot of stuff. Here is what he looks like!:<div> <img id="pink panther" src="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pink-panther.jpg"> </div></section>
